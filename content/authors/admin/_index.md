## About Me

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Human-Centered Design and Engineering at the University of Washington, working with Dr. Sayamindu Dasgupta and Dr. Cecilia Aragon. I earned my B.A. in Applied Mathematics from UC Berkeley, with a focus in Computer Science.

My research interests center around computing education and data visualization. I am particularly interested in the design, teaching, and structure of introductory computing and data courses for non-major students learning programming. I have taught introductory courses at various levels, including at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels, as well as for industry learners interested in advancing their careers.
